# Clustering Methods 1 (Prototype-based clustering)
- **Preprocessing** : PCA, normalization
- **K-means and K-medoids**
	- Clustering Steps
	- Centroids
	- Sum of squared error (SSE), Davis-Bouldin index (DBI)
- **EM (Expectation Maximization)**
	- Mixture models & assumption
	- Clustering steps, likelihood, log-likelihood
- **Gaussian Mixture**
## Preprocessing
### Normalization
- distance-based
### PCA
PCA, **reduces the number of dimensions in large datasets** to principal components that retain most of the original information. It does this by transforming potentially correlated variables into a smaller set of variables, called principal components.
